# Property-Price-Predictor

This is a Flask web application that predicts the price of a house based on various features. It utilizes a trained machine learning model to make predictions.

Features includes:

- Preferred Area
- Availability of Garage
- Furnishing
- Number of stories
- Basement
- Mainroad
- Guestroom
- Hot water heating
- Air Conditioning
- Area
- Number of Bedrooms
- Number of Bathrooms

The Model is trained using Lasso Regression model. Lasso regression is a linear regression technique that incorporates regularization to improve the model's performance and prevent overfitting. It adds a penalty term to the cost function, which helps in shrinking the coefficients of less important features towards zero, effectively performing feature selection. It has R squared value of 0.72282 and an Adjusted R square value of 0.70267 which is considered good.
